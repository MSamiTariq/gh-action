## How to fix it, long-term fix? (Remediation)

We strongly recommend migrating to Flux v2 by following the directions within the [documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/migration/).

## How to fix it, short-term workaround? (Mitigation)

There is no mitigation or workaround for this Availability Risk.

## What is the impact? (Availability Impact)

Flux Legacy (v1) is no longer actively maintained. As a result, relying on Flux Legacy may lead to compatibility issues and a potential lack of support for bug fixes and security patches.

## Why does this exist? (Root Cause)

Flux v1 was re-written as Flux v2 in order to separate its functionalities into specialised controllers and address long-standing feature requests.
