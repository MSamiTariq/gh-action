title: CoreDNS OOM Killed on DNS queries spikes and scale
category: 655c49ff76fdad0024723139

## How to fix it, long-term fix? (Remediation)

1. Add [horizontal auto-scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-horizontal-autoscaling/#enablng-dns-horizontal-autoscaling) for the CoreDNS Deployment based on the number of nodes and CPU cores in the cluster (preferred)

2. Use [NodeLocal DNSCache](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/). This will improve the DNS performance as every node will run a DNS caching agent as a DaemonSet. All DNS queries will be handled by the DNS caching agent running on the node instead of using central kube-dns Service

## How to fix it, short-term workaround? (Mitigation)

1. Increase memory requests/limits to greater than 200Mi (based on your scale)
2. Increase number of CoreDNS replicas to 5 or more (based on your scale)

The mitigations should be considered temporary until you are able to remediate this Latent Availability Risk.

## What is the impact? (Availability Impact)

Cluster wide total outage and denial of service (DoS) when DNS queries are spiked and CoreDNS reaches itâ€™s memory limits. CoreDNS outage has cluster wide blast radius.

## Why does this exist? (Root Cause)

A sudden spike in DNS queries can lead to CoreDNS running out of memory and getting OOM Killed.

## Who is impacted and when? (Trigger Conditions)

_Affected Versions_  
All CoreDNS versions

_Affected Images_  
All CoreDNS image versions
