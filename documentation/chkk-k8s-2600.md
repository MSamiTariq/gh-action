## How to fix it, short-term workaround? (Mitigation)

There is no mitigation or workaround for this Availability Risk.

## What is the impact? (Availability Impact)

If a version of Envoy reaches end-of-life, it is no longer supported. This may result in the software having incompatibilities leading to unknown behavior.

## Why does this exist? (Root Cause)

As per Envoyâ€™s official documentation, in order to accommodate downstream projects, new Envoy releases are produced on a fixed release schedule (the 15th day of each quarter), with an acceptable delay of up to 2 weeks, with a hard deadline of 3 weeks.
