## How to fix it, long-term fix? (Remediation)

We strongly recommend upgrading Crossplane to one of the supported versions as per the guidelines provided by Crossplane maintainers. See the [supported releases](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane#releases).

## How to fix it, short-term workaround? (Mitigation)

There is no mitigation or workaround for this Availability Risk.

## What is the impact? (Availability Impact)

Your current version of Crossplane has reached end-of-life, which means that it is no longer supported and your software may have incompatibilities leading to unknown behavior.

## Why does this exist? (Root Cause)

Crossplane has a release cycle of 13 weeks. The 13 weeks comprise of 3 stages:

- Weeks 1-11: Active Development
- Week 12: Feature Freeze
- Week 13: Code Freeze

This results in four releases per year, with the most recent three releases being maintained at any given time. When a new release is cut, the fourth most recent release reaches end of life (EOL). Users can expect any given release to be maintained for nine months.

Following are the currently supported and upcoming Crossplane releases.
